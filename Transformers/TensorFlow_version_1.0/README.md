## Transformer

For an updated version in Tensorflow 2.0 see OTHER folder in this REPO. 

Transformer on Tensorflow low level API with a statitc graph based on paper "Attention Is All You Need".

This transformer is for english-to-portuguese translation. The dataset for training contains around 50,000 sentence pairs. 

I wrote a post about this implementation here:
